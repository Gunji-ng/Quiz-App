# Quiz-App
Andela Learning Community (ALC) #7DaysofCodeChallenge

This app has been submitted for the "ALC 7 Days of Code Challenge"
as a requirement for the "Google Africa Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics" course
hosted on Udacity and being monitored on Slack.

The App is named "Footy Quiz" and its purpose is to test the user's knowledge of football.
I went with a football themed App as the sport is a great passion of mine.

The App implements TextViews, Checkboxes and RadioButtons (in RadioGroups) to get input from the user
which are then checked for correctness when the user clicks the "Submit" button.

The logic for checking if the user's input is correct/wrong and grading accordingly is handled by "if/else" statements.
